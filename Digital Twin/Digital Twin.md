## Literature Survey on Digital Twins 
A digital twin is an up-to-date representation, a model, of an actual physical asset in operation. It reflects the current asset condition and includes relevant historical data about the asset. Digital twins can be used to evaluate the current condition of the asset, and more importantly, predict future behavior, refine the control, or optimize operation.

A digital twin can be a model of a component, a system of components, or a system of systems—such as pumps, engines, power plants, manufacturing lines, or a fleet of vehicles. Digital twin models can include physics-based approaches or statistical approaches. The models reflect the operating asset’s current environment, age, and configuration, which typically involves direct streaming of asset data into tuning algorithms.
